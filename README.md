# Upgrade Your Car

## Game Description

Upgrade Your Car is a chapter-based progression game where players control a car that starts at a predetermined speed and has its own power level. At the beginning of the game, the car collects power from the ground to increase its strength. Interacting with other moving vehicles can also enhance its power. However, if our car's power level is lower than other vehicles it interacts with, we lose. This results in restarting the chapter. The game features obstacles that decrease our car's power level. Upon completing a chapter, the power collected from the ground and earned from interactions with other vehicles converts into in-game currency. This currency can be used to increase the starting power level or enhance the value of collected ground power.
